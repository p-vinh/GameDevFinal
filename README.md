The player will experience a world where conflict between vampires and humans is prominent. Through an engaging Blood mechanic, we strive to not only provide a game that’s fun but also challenging in terms of managing health throughout gameplay. 

# Game Story:
In this world, there lives two species: Vampires and Humans. Humans have two civilizations, the Overworld (where the rich and powerful live) and the Underworld (where the poor, criminals and the sick stay). To ensure peace between humans and vampires, vampires and humans agreed on a treaty. Within the treaty, humans that stay in the Overworld will never be attacked by vampires under any circumstance. However, vampires are allowed to attack the Underworld dwellers. 

Our main protagonist (the player), who once lived in the Overworld, was punished by the Supreme Overlords, a council that has the sole responsibility to ensure that both sides respect the treaty. The Supreme Overlords banished the player into the Underworld, due to an unforgettable crime that the player enacted. The crime that the player committed is not clear at the start of the game, but later on will be revealed that one of the Supreme Overlords (a vampire) killed their significant other.

With this in mind, the player has a strong determination to get back to the Overworld. However, the player will have to fight vampires and human guards to reach the overworld. Their plan is to take out the vampire overlords that rule the Overworld(bosses), in hopes of finally being free.
